A simple, and persistent, SQLite database for Web and Workers, based on [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js#readme) and [sqlite-tag](https://github.com/WebReflection/sqlite-tag#readme).



### âš  Warning about Workers

Obviously I was too naive to believe I could `import(...)` modules in 2021 inside workers too, but [the reality is different](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45578811/2800218):

  * **Chrome** works without any issue whatsoever as *Worker* from the main thread, but *Service Worker* apparently cannot `import(...)` anything
  * **Firefox** never had a dynamic `import`, or even static, I believe, so *Worker* here won't work
  * **WebKit** has issues since 2016 too

This means that while this module recommendation is to use its *SQLiteWorker* export, or to use the directly its *init* export via *Service Worker*, none of these recommendation actually work as expected, so that for a cross browser experience, using the *init* export from the main thread is the only option.

Please note the *WASM* module *should* also offload from the main thread, but the thing is that I'd love for browsers to fix their inconsistencies regarding ES Modules and remove this whole warning session once they do.



## How to import this module

This module is pre-bundled in a way it should work, and survive, 3rd party tools, but it needs to be able to reach its own `dist` folder.

Accordingly, the easiest way to use this module is the following:

```js
// note: no ?module needed, this is already exported as ESM
import {init, SQLiteWorker} from '//unpkg.com/sqlite-worker';

// either direct init([options])
// or use SQLiteWorker with defaults (Chrome only)
SQLiteWorker({name: 'my-db'}).then(() => {
  console.log('ready');
});
```

Options defaults, such as `dir` and `library`, or even the `Worker` path, are all resolved automatically, as long as all `dist` files are reachable.

It is, however, possible to change these configurations.



### Initialization Options

Both `init([options])` and `SQLiteWorker([options])` optionally accept a configuration/options object with the following fields:

  * **name**: the persistent database name. By default it's the *string* `'sqlite-worker'`
  * **database**: an initial SQLite database, as `Uint8Array` instance. This is used only the very first time, and it fallbacks to `new Uint8Array(0)`.
  * **timeout**: minimum interval, in milliseconds, between saves, to make storing, and exporting, the database, less greedy. By default it's the *number* `250`.


#### Direct init Extra Options

These options work only with direct initialization, so either in the main thread or via *Service Worker* (once fixed in Chrome) after importing its `init` export.

  * **update**: a *function* that receives latest version of the database, as `Uint8Array`, whenever some query executed an `INSERT`, a `DELETE`, or an `UPDATE`.



#### SQLiteWorker Extra Options

These options work only with `SQLiteWorker` initialization.

  * **worker**: the *string* path where the *JS* worker to use is located. By default, this is the [dist/worker.js](./dist/worker.js) file, which is a pre-optimized version of [this source](./esm/worker.js).



#### Extra Options

These options are resolved by default internally to find the right files. Change these options only if you know what you are doing.

  * **dir**: where to find `sql.js` files. By default it's the current module folder plus `/../sqlite`.
  * **library**: where to find the `sqlite-worker` library itself. By default is wherever the module has been exported.




### Module exports

Both `init(...)` and `SQLiteWorker(...)` resolves with the [sqlite-tag API](https://github.com/WebReflection/sqlite-tag#api), except for the `raw` utility, which is not implemented via the *Worker* interface, but it's exported within the `init(...)`, as it requires a special instance that won't survive `postMessage` dance.

The API in a nutshell is:

  * **all**: a template literal tag to retrieve all rows that match the query
  * **get**: a template literal tag to retrieve one row that matches the query
  * **query**: a template literal tag to simply query the database (no result returned)

All tags are *asynchronous*, so that it's possible to *await* their result.



### Direct usage

This is currently the cross browser way to use this module, and it won't work within a *Service Worker* until Chrome fixes its bug.

```js
import {init} from 'sqlite-worker';

// init([options])
init({name: 'my-db'}).then(async ({all, get, query}) => {
  await query`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)`;
  const {total} = await get`SELECT COUNT(id) as total FROM todos`;
  if (total < 1) {
    console.log('Inserting some value');
    await query`INSERT INTO todos (value) VALUES (${'a'})`;
    await query`INSERT INTO todos (value) VALUES (${'b'})`;
    await query`INSERT INTO todos (value) VALUES (${'c'})`;
  }
  console.log(await all`SELECT * FROM todos`);
});
```



### Worker usage (Chrome only)

This module can also be used as *Worker*, which is a recommendation where the browser is compatible.

If specified, you can pass your own worker via the `worker` option, but by default, this module can be initialized as such:

```js
import {SQLiteWorker} from 'sqlite-worker';

// SQLiteWorker([options])
SQLiteWorker({name: 'my-db'})
  .then(async ({all, get, query}) => {
    await query`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)`;
    const {total} = await get`SELECT COUNT(id) as total FROM todos`;
    if (total < 1) {
      console.log('Inserting some value');
      await query`INSERT INTO todos (value) VALUES (${'a'})`;
      await query`INSERT INTO todos (value) VALUES (${'b'})`;
      await query`INSERT INTO todos (value) VALUES (${'c'})`;
    }
    console.log(await all`SELECT * FROM todos`);
  });
```



## Compatibility

This module requires a browser compatible with *WASM* and dynamic `import(...)`. This module won't work in old Edge or IE, as these don't even know what's a *Service Worker*.

Please note if you bundle this module there are chances it might not work as expected, as it needs to import *WASM* and other files at runtime, and bundlers might not give it a chance to find these files. Keep the `dist` folder as it is, and import this module from it.
